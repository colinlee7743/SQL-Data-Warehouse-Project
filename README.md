# ðŸ“Š Data Warehouse and Analytics Project Using SQL

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project combines the concepts of data warehousing and data analytics using SQL. It demonstrates the end-to-end journey of raw data from ingestion to data analytics and reporting using structured SQL scripts. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This project involves:
1. **Data Architecture**: Build and set up a data warehouse using MySQL.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports for actionable insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source**: [Dataset](datasets)
- This project uses CSV files extracted from two simulated source systems (CRM and ERP), which provides data related to customer demographic, product details and sales transactions.

## ðŸ”§ Skills Demonstrated
- Data Warehouse Schema Design
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Joins and Aggregations
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Customer and Product Reporting
- Data Quality Checks
